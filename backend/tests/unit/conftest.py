Unit test fixtures and configuration.

Unit tests should not require database access and test pure functions/logic.
Some subdirectories (utils, services) do exercise db_session for sync/derive
helpers that are thin wrappers over a single query — those tests still live
under unit/ by existing convention (see test_odometer_sync.py, test_def_sync.py).
